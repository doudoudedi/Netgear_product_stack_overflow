#### EX6100v1-exp

The script of using ex6100 device is mainly written here. Because upnpd service is ported, there will be more devices affected by this vulnerability in addition to the devices officially notified. However, there are only ex6100 devices in hand, so there is only the script of using this device. The rest of the scripts can be explored by ourselves or communicated with me

Before using the script, please determine the firmware version of the target machine. Because this script will crash the service. If the attack fails and the machine can be restarted next to it, the machine will automatically start the vulnerability service. After determining the firmware version, use the script again to succeed in the attack
